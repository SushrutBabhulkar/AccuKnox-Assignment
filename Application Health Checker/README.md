Problem statement

Please write a script that can check the uptime of an application and determine if it is functioning correctly or not. The script must accurately assess the application's status by checking HTTP status codes. 
It should be able to detect if the application is 'up', meaning it is functioning correctly, or 'down', indicating that it is unavailable or not responding.

Solution

The Health checker script takes application url as input and displays the status on console.
